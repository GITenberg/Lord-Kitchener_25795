description: Horatio Herbert Kitchener was Irish by birth but English by extraction,
  being born in County Kerry, the son of an English colonel. The fanciful might see
  in this first and accidental fact the presence of this simple and practical man
  amid the more mystical western problems and dreams which were very distant from
  his mind, an element which clings to all his career and gives it an unconscious
  poetry. He had many qualities of the epic hero, and especially this -- that he was
  the last man in the world to be the epic poet. There is something almost provocative
  to superstition in the way.
